# AGENTS

This package is the web UI for the Vim-style PDF/EPUB viewer.

## UI Guidance

- Keep layouts minimal and boxy.
- Always use theme tokens (no hardcoded colors) so future themes apply seamlessly.
- Avoid placeholders or extra chrome unless requested.
- Use base font size (16px) across UI; convey hierarchy with color or font-weight instead of smaller text sizes.
- Use generic "document" wording; avoid PDF- or buffer-specific copy.
- Use shadcn/ui components when adding UI primitives.
- Tailwind CSS v4 is the styling system for this package.
